# Join a Welcoming Group to Encourage New Users

Can we make the Fediverse the welcoming-est place in social media?

We're soft-launching a new welcoming committee. All you have to do is reply to introduction posts to say hello and offer help.

We hope you'll follow [@welcoming](https://indieweb.social/@welcoming@venera.social) and mention to the group how many people you've welcomed, so we all know that we're working as a team.

You can point people to [spreadmastodon.com](https://spreadmastodon.com), [discover.fedified.com](https://discover.fedified.com), or any other resources you like!
