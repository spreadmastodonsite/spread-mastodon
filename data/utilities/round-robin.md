# Spread Mastodon Idea for Service Providers for “Round-Robin”

**DRAFT FOR EXPLORATION**

## Concept: Create a Round Robin of Four Servers That Will Be “Featured” in the Official Mastodon App

This round-robin of featured servers will each be given the placement in the official application for the Spread Mastodon site presented to new users onboarding.

The official Spread Mastodon onboarding process will “round robin” between these four servers, giving a different one this featured placement where every other request for the onboarding tool will evenly spread out the load of new users across each server. Should any server go offline, the application will move over to the remaining live servers.

Every quarter in a year, one of these four will “drop out” and be replaced with a new server that also meets these same requirements.

Servers that rotate out of the round-robin can be brought back every year if there are no other servers that meet these requirements.

Servers in the round-robin would commit to everything in the [Mastodon Server Covenant](https://joinmastodon.org/covenant), but then also additionally commit to:

- Commit to being live for the next year, and will need to recommit annually.
- Be a generally focused server in terms of content, neither geo-targeted nor targeted to a particular community.
- Must be on the main branch of Mastodon server software, running no more than one release behind, and commit to timely updates as new security patches and new releases of Mastodon are released.
- Must not be on the [Tier0-council blocklist](https://codeberg.org/oliphant/blocklists/src/branch/main/blocklists/tier0-council.csv) (an 80% consensus list of server blocks from twelve high-regarded blocklist authors).
- For Spread Mastdon’s original English language site, servers must have English as the primary language.
- Be hosted at a well-peered hosting environment for the geographic region targeted.
- Allow for instant registration.
- Has been in existence for over one year or more.
- Have some legal entity such as a non-profit organization, or another legal entity of two or more people.
- Have a third-party DDOS denial of service protection system.
- Have a robust privacy policy for users.
- Has over 15,000 active monthly users or more according to [instances.social](https://instances.social/).
- Has over 60,000 registered users or more according to [instances.social](https://instances.social/).
- Have an uptime of over 97 percent over the last year according to [instances.social](https://instances.social/).
- Is well Federated - over 20,000 connections or more, as counted by [instances.social](https://instances.social/).
- Have a #Fediblock policy in sync with Mastodon.social - and agree to a system of submitting new Fediblock candidates to everyone in the round-robin.

Falling out of any of these requirements or of any of the requirements of the Mastodon Server Covenant would be grounds for removal from the round-robin and replacement with another server that does meet these criteria.
