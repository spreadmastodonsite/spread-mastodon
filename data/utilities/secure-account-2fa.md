# Secure Your Account with Two-Factor Authentication

To make it harder for someone other than you to access your Mastodon account, it's recommended to use a two-factor authentication method in addition to a password.

This involves using an authenticator app on your smartphone or mobile device. If you don't already have one, you can download a free app like Google Authenticator for Android or Apple iOS.

1. Once you have the app, you can set up two-factor authentication on your Mastodon account by logging in on a desktop browser.
2. 2. Then click on your user preferences.
3. Then click on the two-factor authentication sub-section, click set up, and follow the instructions to scan a QR code using your authenticator app.
4. Your authentication app will give you a six-digit token, enter that into the form on your Mastodon account.

**SUCCESS: You should now be set up.**

It's also important to back up your 2FA data by storing recovery codes in a safe place in case you lose your phone or can't access the authenticator app. When logging in to your Mastodon account in the future, you'll need to enter both your password and two-factor code to access your account from that browser or app.
