# Verify Your Mastodon Account (With No $8 Dollars Required)

There are several ways to verify your account on Mastodon as yours and to make it clear to others that you are verified.

## Method One: Promote your Fediverse account on a third-party site.

The is the first technique you can do, and the easiest one, however this does not get you an official "green checkmark." So there are trade offs. But it is a good start:

Have a featured place on your website or social account that links back to your Mastodon Account.

Then add a link to this same site or other social account to your Mastodon profile page and to your pinned "introduction post."

This basic cross-linking can work to informally verify your account but, as we mentioned, it doesn’t give you a "green checkmark" that will show up on your profile, and in search on Mastodon.

The next two techniques do get you this checkmark.

## Method Two: If you have a Gravatar, Flipboard, Medium, or Github account, you can authenticate from any of those services.

Each of these services - Gravatar, Flipboard, Medium, and Github - now integrates into the Mastdon identity system. If you have existing accounts on these services, it is simple to link those accounts to your Mastodon profile and use them for verification. Here are instructions for each:

- Gravatar - Go to the [official Gravatar website](https://en.gravatar.com/) and log in. Then choose, "My Profile" from the top navigation on the site. Then choose, "Verified Services" from the right-hand sidebar. Then in the pull-down menu choose "Mastodon," and click the "Add" button. Then follow the instructions from there.
- Flipboard - If you have a Flipboard account, go to your [account page](https://flipboard.com/settings/profile-settings). Then choose "Social Settings" from the upper navigation. Then fill in your Mastodon profile address using the format: https://something.somewhere/@profile. Then hit "Submit."
- Medium - If you already have a Medium account, go to your [account settings page](https://medium.com/me/settings/security). Click on the "Security and Apps" tab in the upper navigation of that page, then choose the "Connect Mastodon" setting and follow the instructions.
- GitHub - If you already have a GitHub account, go to your account profile page and choose "Edit Profile." Under social accounts, look for an empty form field that reads "link social account." There you can paste the URL of your Mastodon profile, using the format: https://something.somewhere/@profile. Then hit "Submit."

## Method Three: Verify Your Account Via Your Website Directly

This is the most advanced option and would require some HTML coding. But it is also powerful.

To do this you go through this process:

1. Log in using your Mastodon server's web interface.
2. Click on the “Edit Profile” link under your profile image, and then look at the Verification section. This is found on the lower mid-section of this profile page. _(Warning: This next section will need you to have the ability to edit the HTML code on your website.)_
3. Copy the HTML code from the Verification section on Mastodon. You will then need to paste and save that code into your website's code in the appropriate place.
4. Next, you should return to the Mastodon Edit Profile page, and there you enter your official website's URL into the "Profile Metadata" area in your Mastodon profile. And remember you must include https:// at the beginning.
5. Click the "Save Changes" button for your profile edits.

**Success!** After you've completed all of the Method Three steps above, you'll see a link to your official website on your Mastodon profile that has become green with a check mark beside it, indicating that you are the site's owner.

This green check mark will also be visible in upcoming versions of Mastodon search next to your account name, verifying your account.
